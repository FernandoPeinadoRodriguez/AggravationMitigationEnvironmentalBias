# AggravationMitigationEnvironmentalBias
Version 2.0.0

This Python program file calculates optimal punishment proportionality from the simulations and robustness checks reported in Peinado, F. (2023) "Modelling Aggravation, Mitigation and Environmental Bias from the Behavioral Economics Perspective."

The code has been run in version 3.9 of Python and provides the results in the form of the figures presented in the article using the ‘matplotlib’ library. These figures are automatically saved as .png files in the same directory where this Python program file might be stored.

# Usage
To replicate the outputs presented in the article, simply run this Python program file.

To perform simulations and robustness checks with different values of the parameters, follow the instructions depicted in steps labeled "# Set of predefined values for sigma, beta, psi, d and rho." Notice that rho in the file corresponds to gamma in the article.
